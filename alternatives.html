        <h1><p>Different Sources of Alternative Energy</p></h1>
        <br>
        <h4><p>As the issues that result from the use of traditional fossil fuels become more prominent, alternative fuel sources like the ones mentioned here are likely to gain further importance.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Their benefits alleviate many of the problems caused by fossil fuel use, particularly when it comes to emissions. However, the advancement of some of these technologies has been slowed down due to the amount of investment needed to make them viable.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Through combining them all we may be able to positively affect issues like climate change, pollution and many others.</p></h4>

        <h3>1. Solar Power</h3>
        <br>
        <h4><p>When most people think of alternative energy sources they tend to use solar power as an example. The technology has evolved massively over the years and is now used for large-scale energy production and power generation for single homes.</p>
        <br>
        <p>A number of countries have introduced initiatives to promote the growth of solar power. The United Kingdom’s ‘Feed-in Tariff’ is one example, as is the United States’ ‘Solar Investment Tax Credit’.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This energy source is completely renewable and the costs of installation are outweighed by the money saved in energy bills from traditional suppliers. Nevertheless, solar cells are prone to deterioration over large periods of time and are not as effective in unideal weather conditions.</p></h4>
        <br>
        <h3>2. Hydroelectric Energy</h3>
        <br>
        <h4><p>Hydroelectric methods actually are some of the earliest means of creating energy, though their use began to decline with the rise of fossil fuels. Despite this, they still account for approximately seven percent of the energy produced in the United States.</p>
        <br>
        Hydroelectric energy carries with it a number of benefits. Not only is it a clean source of energy, which means it doesn’t create pollution and the myriad issues that arise from it, but it is also a renewable energy source.</p></h4>
        <br>
        <h3>3. Waste Energy</h3>
        <br>
        <h4><p>Water again proves itself to be a valuable contributor to alternative energy fuel sources with wave energy converters. These hold an advantage over tidal energy sources because they can be placed in the ocean in various situations and locations.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Much like with tidal energy, the benefits come in the lack of waste produced. It is also more reliable than many other forms of alternative energy and has enormous potential when used properly.</p></h4>
